# Camp Horlivka

Hello Boris, hello Natasha
Here I am at Camp Horlivka
Camp is very entertaining
And they say we'll have some fun if bombs stop raining

When Ukraines make little drones fly
Even more of our generals die
Locals call us abominations
Yet we still keep on this very Special Operation

Morale much worse than Bay of Bakoz
Is like ad from Bell of Tacos
Officers give out stupid orders
When they no look, then we all go run for borders

Missiles crashing, shrapnel flying
All the while now, childrens dying
Babushkas with guns taking their stand
Kinda wish I'd jumped off back there at Snake Island

You remember Ivan Petrov?
We'll still searching for him parts of
Nazis nowhere, peasants hating
Tell Dear Leader moose and squirrel are dominating
